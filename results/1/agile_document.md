# Agile Project Documentation: Pygame Gobang Development

## Project Overview
The Pygame Gobang project aims to create a digital version of "Five in a Row" board game. The project is to be broken down into a series of two-week sprints, each with specific deliverables and focus areas to create a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) and further enhance the game.

### Sprint 1: Project Setup and Basic Game Board

#### Week 1 Tasks
- **Project Initialization:**
  - Create a project repository.
  - Set up Python virtual environment and install Pygame.
  - Establish directory structure and naming conventions.

- **Development Environment:**
  - Configure a Python and Pygame development environment.
  - Set up Git version control and document the commit process.

- **Basic Project Skeleton:**
  - Write a main.py file to initialize the Pygame window.
  - Implement a game loop with event handling stubs.

- **Game Board Design:**
  - Define grid size and the data structure for the board state.

#### Week 2 Tasks
- **Board Visualization:**
  - Develop function to draw the game board in the Pygame window.
  - Design board and background colors and elements.

- **Stone Placement Representation:**
  - Visual representation for black and white stones.

- **Basic Interaction:**
  - Handle mouse clicks to place stones on the board.

- **Testing and Review:**
  - Test board display and stone placement functionality.
  - Conduct code review and necessary refactoring.

- **Sprint Retrospective:**
  - Review sprint progress and backlog for the next sprint.

#### Sprint 1 Deliverables
- Project repository with setup and commit documentation.
- Running Pygame window with game loop in main.py.
- Visual representation of the game board with mouse input functionality.

### Sprint 2: Basic Game Logic and User Interface

#### Week 3 Tasks
- **Game Logic Implementation:**
  - Turn-based system for two-player moves.
  - Win condition check.
  - Prevention of moves on occupied spaces.

- **User Interface Development:**
  - Simple UI layout with the game board and status messages.
  - "Restart" button for new games.

- **Game Status Feedback:**
  - Text display for game status messages.

#### Week 4 Tasks
- **Interaction Enhancement:**
  - Visual feedback for hovering over potential moves.

- **Testing and Debugging:**
  - Test new game logic and UI elements.

- **Code Review and Refactoring:**
  - Review code for improvements and refactor.

- **Sprint Retrospective:**
  - Hold a retrospective meeting and update backlog.

#### Sprint 2 Deliverables
- Turn-based game logic with win/loss detection.
- A user interface with status messages and a "Restart" button.
- Enhanced stone placement interaction.

### Sprint 3: Gameplay Refinement and Demo Preparation

#### Week 5 Tasks
- **Gameplay Experience Enhancement:**
  - Sound effects for game actions.
  - Visual effects for winning sequence.

- **User Interface Polish:**
  - Improved visual design for game board and stones.
  - Enhanced UI elements styling and positioning.

- **Code Optimization:**
  - Performance profiling and optimization.

#### Week 6 Tasks
- **Playtesting:**
  - Internal playtesting and adjustments.

- **Documentation:**
  - Create README and document the codebase.

- **Demo Release Preparation:**
  - Package the game for distribution.
  - Set up a download page or channel.

- **Sprint Review and Retrospective:**
  - Review completed work and update backlog.

#### Sprint 3 Deliverables
- Polished version of the game with visual and auditory enhancements.
- Professional and user-friendly interface.
- Documentation for players and developers.
- Packaged playable demo ready for public release.
