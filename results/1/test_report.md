**Defects Logged:**

- **Defect ID #001**: Invalid Move Placement Accepted
  - Description: The game accepts moves placed on occupied positions without displaying an error message.
  - Severity: High

  - Suggested Fix: Implement validation to check if a position is occupied before accepting a move.

- **Defect ID #002**: Draw Condition Not Recognized
  - Description: The game fails to recognize a draw condition when no more moves are possible.
  - Severity: Medium
  - Steps to Reproduce: Fill up the board without any player achieving a win condition.
  - Suggested Fix: Add logic to detect when no empty positions are left and declare a draw if no winner is found.

- **Defect ID #003**: Incomplete Game State Load
  - Description: When loading a saved game state, the move history is not restored, affecting the undo functionality.
  - Severity: Low
  - Steps to Reproduce: Save a game state, restart the game, and load the saved state.
  - Suggested Fix: Ensure that the move history is included in the saved state and correctly restored during load.

**Conclusion and Recommendations:**
The unit tests have revealed some critical issues that need to be addressed before the game can be released. It is recommended to fix the identified defects, starting with the highest severity, and then re-run the unit tests to confirm that the issues have been resolved. Additional testing, such as integration and system testing, should also be conducted to ensure overall game quality.
